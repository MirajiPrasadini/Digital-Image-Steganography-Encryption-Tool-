# Digital-Image-Steganography-Encryption-Tool

Image steganography is a system that can conceal the secret message into the image without being notification by eyes of the human. Keeping in mind the end goal to guarantee the security of the substance for the delicate message, procedure steganography is being actualized. Steganography turn out to be more critical as more individuals join the internet insurgency. Steganography is the craft of hiding data in ways that keeps the recognition of concealed messages. Steganography incorporates a variety of specialized strategies that conceal the message from being seen or found. Steganography conceals the emitted message inside the host information set and is nearly impalpable and is to be dependably conveyed to the right recipient. The host information set is intentionally adulterated, however clandestinely, intended to be imperceptible upon examination of the data.  

This project is developed for, 

          Hiding information in any image file. 
          Create a security tool that can be used to hide data inside a 24-bit color image. 
          Ease of use, and should use user friendly a graphical user interface.
          Work cross-platform.
          Effectively hide a message, and should be able to retrieve this message afterwards. 
          Explore techniques of hiding data using encryption module of this project.
          Extract techniques of getting secret data using decryption module
